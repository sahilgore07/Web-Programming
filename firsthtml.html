    <p> Writing my first HTML code was an exciting experience. 
        I started by creating a simple webpage structure, 
        defining the title and adding a heading. 
        Then, <b> wrote a paragraph with some text. </b>
        When I viewed it in the browser, seeing my work 
        displayed was both rewarding and motivating.
